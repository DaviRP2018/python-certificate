# ðŸ“˜ PCPP1 Study Repository â€“ Advanced Classes and OOP in Python

This repository contains my notes, code examples, and practice exercises in preparation for the **PCPP1 â€“ Certified Professional in Python Programming 1** certification. The focus is on mastering advanced concepts of **classes and object-oriented programming in Python**, including topics such as:

- Class mechanics and constructors  
- Inheritance, composition, and polymorphism  
- Magic methods and operator overloading  
- Class and static methods  
- Encapsulation and access control
